<p><strong><em>Do you desire to become a part of a close-knit pack led by SV startup veterans who can accelerate your growth 10X (compared to the corporate trajectory/culture)?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>If you’ve answered with 3 resounding ""yes"", then we want to meet you!</em></strong></p>
<p>We are seeking a passionate and proactive <strong>AI/GenAI Engineer</strong> with at least 2 years of professional experience to join us at a pivotal moment.

<h2>Tasks</h2>
<ul>
<li>Navigate ambiguity and adapt quickly in a fast-moving team</li>
<li>Demonstrate ownership: proactively identify challenges and raise your hand to drive solutions</li>

<li>Familiarity with LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, Google ADK (preferred)</li>
<li>Experience with containerization and Docker (preferred)</li>

</ul>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competitive Compensation &#x26; Meaningful Equity:</strong> We value talent and back it with fair, founder-level alignment. You’ll own a real stake in the company’s future.</li>
<li><strong>High-Impact, High-Ownership Role:</strong> You won’t be a cog in the machine. You’ll own initiatives end-to-end and help shape the core of our AI stack and company direction.</li>
<li><strong>Work Directly with the CEO &#x26; Founding Team:</strong> Collaborate daily with the CEO and technical leadership to drive product, strategy, and long-term vision.</li>
<li><strong>Build What Doesn’t Exist (Yet):</strong> We’re working on first-principle AI infrastructure that doesn’t exist elsewhere. If you’re here to do original, meaningful work — this is it.</li>
<li><strong>Zero Bureaucracy, Maximum Autonomy:</strong> We move fast, stay lean, and keep decision-making close to the builders. Your input drives the roadmap.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible, But In-Person Matters:</strong> We’re remote-first, but we believe in the power of face-to-face time. We hold monthly gatherings/hackathons in SF and Europe, to stay aligned and build real momentum together. Results still matter more than hours — but we show up when it counts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our Hiring Process</strong></p>
<p>We move fast, stay transparent, and focus on real collaboration. Here’s what the process looks like:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Intro Call</strong> – A quick chat to align on expectations, interests, and team fit.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Deep Dive</strong> – A focused conversation with our Engineering Manager to explore your technical thinking and past work.</li>
<li><strong>CEO Interview</strong> – A strategic discussion around vision, mindset, and long-term alignment.</li>
<li><strong>Reference Collection</strong> – We’ll speak with a few people you’ve worked closely with.</li>
<li><strong>Paid Trial (~5 Days)</strong> – A short, real-world engagement so we can see how we work together — happening in parallel with offer and terms discussion.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As a startup, you can expect a fast-paced environment where extreme ownership is required.</li>
<li>If you are seeking a traditional corporate 9-to-5 role, this may not be the right fit.</li>

<ul>
<li>As a startup, you can expect a fast-paced environment where extreme ownership is required.</li>
<li>If you are seeking a traditional corporate 9-to-5 role, this may not be the right fit.</li>
